Hi I just had a car accident and wanted to report it. OK, I hope you're alright, what happened? I was driving on the I-18 and I hit another car. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm just a little shaken up. That's understandable. Can you give me your full name? Sure, it's Sarah standl. Do you know what caused the accident? I think I might have hit a pothole. OK, where did the accident take place? On the I-18 freeway. Was anyone else injured? I don't think so. But I'm not sure. OK, well we'll need to do an investigation. Can you give me the other drivers information? Sure, his name is John Radley. And your insurance number. OK. Give me a minute. OK, it's 546452. OK, what type of damages has the car? Headlights are broken and the airbags went off. Are you going to be able to drive it? I don't know. I'm going to have to have it towed. Well, we'll need to get it inspected. I'll go ahead and start the claim and we'll get everything sorted out. Thank you!
